I help mission-driven organizations turn data into action.

Many teams collect data but struggle to make sense of it. I work with organizations to assess their data readiness, improve systems for collection and analysis, and use insights to drive strategic decisions and meaningful impact.

My approach is collaborative and capacity-building. I take time to understand your goals and challenges, then co-create solutions—whether that’s evaluating a program, strengthening your data infrastructure, or supporting long-term learning.
