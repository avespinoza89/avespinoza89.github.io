Hi, there, welcome to my page!

Let me tell you a bit about myself.

I work at the intersection of Data Analysis and Visualization, Evaluation, Strategic Planning and Implementation, and Systems Change. 

I help organizations utilize data to evaluate their work and make strategic decisions that lead to positive change and improvement.

I continue to learn about each of these topics and hope I can share some of that with you. 

Go ahead and browse the website for examples of previous projects and work, resources, and other helpful information.
