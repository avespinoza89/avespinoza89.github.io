Hi, there, welcome to my page! Thank you for visiting.

Let me tell you a bit about myself.

I work at the intersection of Data Analysis and Visualization, Evaluation, Strategic Planning and Implementation, and Systems Change. 

All this means is, I help organizations utilize their data to answer questions such as: 

- How well are we doing our work? 
- How effectively are we doing our work? 

I then take the answers to those questions and help organizations 

I continue to learn about each of these topics and hope I can share some of that with you. 

Go ahead and browse the website for examples of previous projects and work, resources, and other 

If you want to connect to learn more about how I can help you, please click my LinkedIn profile and send me a direct message!

I'm looking forward to meeting you!
