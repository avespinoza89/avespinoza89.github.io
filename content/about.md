Hi, there, welcome to my page!

Let me tell you a bit about myself.

I work at the intersection of Data Analysis and Visualization, Evaluation, Strategic Planning and Implementation, and Systems Change. 

I help organizations and businesses utilize data to evaluate their work and make strategic decisions that lead to positive business and social change and improvement. 

Go ahead and browse the website for examples of previous projects and work, resources, and other helpful information.

Let's talk about how I can help your organization harness the power of data and evaluation. Send me an [email](mailto:av_espinoza@outlook.com) or direct message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-espinoza-es/" target="_blank">LinkedIn!</a>
