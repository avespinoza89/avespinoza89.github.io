title: Welcome to my website!

Hi, I'm sure you've had a chance to read the About Me section. If not, I encourage you to go back and read through that--it'll only take a minute. 

This is my first post and I'm excited to finally have a website up and running! 

This is a work in progress as much as an experiment in website development. I am grateful to the R community for sharing so many resources on how to create a website. I'm particularly grateful to Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, Alison Presmanes Hill for sharing their knowledge and expertise through <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/" target="_blank">blogdown.</a> The fact you are reading this right now is evidence of the excellent resource they've created and that anyone can start their own website with R if they are able to follow directions and willing to put a bit of time, effort, and patience.

Here, I will share examples of my work, resources to help you learn about data and evaluation, and demonstrate how I can help your organization or business achieve your fullest potential.  

Please come back as often as you'd like and remember, if you want to grab a coffee and chat about data and evaluation, simply send me an [email](mailto:av.espinoza@outlook.com) or message on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-espinoza-es/" target="_blank">LinkedIn.</a>
