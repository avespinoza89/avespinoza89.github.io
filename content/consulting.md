I help mission-driven organizations and businesses harness the power of their data to solve real challenges, improve operations, and drive positive social and business outcomes.

Many organizations are already collecting data—but few have the time or tools to turn that data into actionable insights. I work with clients to uncover meaningful patterns in their information, build systems to collect and analyze data more effectively, and use those insights to inform strategic decisions.

My approach is grounded in collaboration. I start by learning about your goals, challenges, and context. Together, we identify key areas for improvement, define clear project objectives and results, and develop an implementation plan. I also focus on building your team’s capacity so that data-informed decision-making continues long after our engagement ends.
