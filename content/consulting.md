I help mission-driven organizations use data and evaluation to learn, improve, and grow.

From strategy to implementation, I support organizations in assessing their capacity, strengthening their evaluation and data practices, and using insights to inform decisions and increase impact.

My approach is collaborative and focused on long-term learning. Whether through tailored consulting, hands-on evaluation support, or customized training, I help teams build the skills and systems they need to drive meaningful change.
