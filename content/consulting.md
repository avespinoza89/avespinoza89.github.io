I help mission-driven organizations use data and evaluation to learn, improve, and grow.

From strategy to implementation, I support organizations in assessing their capacity, strengthening their evaluation and data practices, and using insights to inform decisions and increase impact.

My approach is collaborative and focused on long-term learning. Whether through tailored consulting, hands-on evaluation support, or customized training, I help teams build the skills and systems they need to drive meaningful change.

# What I Can Do for You

### Data Maturity Assessment
Not sure where you stand with your data strategy? I’ll assess your current data practices and work with you to develop a plan for improving data collection, management, analysis, and reporting—so you can use data more effectively at every level.

### Evaluability Assessment
Whether you’re launching a new initiative or refining an existing one, I can help determine the best approach to evaluate your program. I also support organization-wide evaluation strategy development to ensure learning and accountability are built into your work from the start.

### Needs Assessment
Need to make the case for a new program or service? I’ll help you gather and analyze primary and secondary data to understand community needs, identify gaps, and build a strong foundation for funding proposals and strategic planning.

### Program Planning
Have an idea you’re ready to turn into action? I’ll support you through every step of program planning—from theory of change and logic model development to budgeting and implementation planning—so you can move forward with clarity and confidence.

### Grant Writing and Reporting
Whether you need help writing a compelling proposal or developing a strong funder report, I’ll work with you to align your narrative, data, and outcomes to showcase your impact and strengthen funder relationships.

### Process, Outcome, or Impact Evaluations
Want to understand how your programs are working and the difference they’re making? I support the design and implementation of process, outcome, and impact evaluations that are practical, meaningful, and embedded in your ongoing work.

### Data Collection, Management, Analysis, and Visualization
Collecting data but not sure what to do with it? I’ll help you organize your data systems, clean and manage your data, and uncover insights that inform strategic decisions and continuous learning.

### Data Dashboards
Data dashboards transform raw information into actionable insights. We help organizations design and build user-friendly, visually engaging, internal and external dashboards that support learning, decision-making, and strategic alignment. 

### Organizational Capacity Development
Sustainable impact requires more than good programs. It takes strong leadership, clear strategy, and the right infrastructure. I support mission-driven organizations in building the internal capacity they need to thrive. Whether you're strengthening your board, refining your management practices, or aligning your strategy with your values, I bring a thoughtful, collaborative approach to help you build a more effective, resilient organization.

### Workshops and Training
Want to build your team’s data and evaluation capacity? I offer customized trainings designed to meet your team where they are and help them grow.
