Hi, there, welcome to my page!

Let me tell you a bit about myself.

I work at the intersection of Data Analysis and Visualization, Evaluation, Strategic Planning and Implementation, and Systems Change. 

I help organizations and businesses utilize data to evaluate their work and make strategic decisions that lead to positive business and social change and improvement.
